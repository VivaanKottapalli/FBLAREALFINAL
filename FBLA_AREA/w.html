                <h5>Developer & designer</h5>
                <p>CDC.gov claims nearly 1,000 bicyclists die and over 130,000 are injured in crashes that occur on roads in the United States every year. 
                    Unfortunately, many of these accidents occur due to bicyclists not wearing proper gear such as helmets. 
                    Wearing a helmet is known to cause less damage to the head and help prevent permament injuries to the brain. 
                    An effective counter to preventing serious injuries and accidents would be our SafeGuardIQ technology, which is a sensory device in each of our helmets which sends a signal to the nearest local hospital if an accident occurs. </p>
